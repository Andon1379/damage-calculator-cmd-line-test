this is a damage calculator for minecraft that i am writing in python. 

it is not finished, not by a long shot.
to do:
    create dictionaries for: 
	damage done by melee weapons (sword, axe, trident, pickaxe, anything that says it does more damage)
	damage done by ranged weapons (bow, crossbow, trident) 
	    account for diffrent ammunition for bow/crossbow (arrow, firework (crossbow), tipped arrows)
account for charge of strike
account if it was a crit or not
account for enchantments on weapons (sharpness, smite, power)
    account for type of defender (zombie, enderman, dragon, player) 
    account for fire damage applied over time by fire aspect and flame
account for armor points that the defender has
    account for enchantments on armor that the defender has (proc, fire proc, proj. proc)
    account for armor toughness on defender
account for potion effects (strength, weakness) 

plan for orginization: 
folder for dictionaries 
   dictionary for armor
   dictionary for defending entities 
   dictionary for attacking entities
   dictionary for weapons
   dictionary for enchantments
